# Rust Cheat Sheet

## Introduction to Rust
### What is Rust?
Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on performance, safety, and concurrency. It was developed by Mozilla and is now maintained by the Rust Foundation. Rust ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector.

### Why Use Rust?
- **Memory Safety:** Prevents null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and memory leaks.
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions:** High-level features without runtime overhead.
- **Concurrency:** Fearless multithreading with thread safety guarantees.
- **Performance:** Comparable to C/C++, but with safer memory management.
- **Great Tooling:** Built-in package manager (cargo), linter (clippy), and formatter (rustfmt).
